I have been trying for months and months to get her in shape and I know she wants to but shes just extremely lazy and full of excuses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt doesnt help that im abit of a fitness fanatic, I have asked her to come to the gym with me, she says shes too embarassed. Lets go for a run, same thing. Have u tried a vegan diet? no will power. I  found some cool workout videos u can do at home, never did it. Brought her a fitbit, doesnt use it. Asked her to count calories, says its too much effort. Asked her to record her weight every 2 weeks, scales ran out of battery, I found a cool subreddit (loseit), never went on it. She also lies about what she eats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheres an excuse for everything. When I think of my future, I think of her suffering from health problems as a result and ultimately dying young because of this. Nobody wants their wife to die at 60 and life the rest of their lives alone. When I think of a perfect future, it is with her but a healthy version and im thinking of just cutting it off and saving myself the heartbreak in the future because I dont have much hope that she will change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can call me shallow but part of this is the attraction side. Im not gonna sugar coat it but obese people just arnt attractive to me so right now im only with her for her personality. When she was smaller she was really pretty which is what made me first go up and speak to her, now I dont even recognise her. If you have any advice or comments I will be super grateful, thankyou\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I went to sleep when this had about 20 comments and i woke up to over a thousand! Thankyou for all your kind messages and stories. Im glad people understand where im coming from. I thought most people will be angry that I dare to question her weight and how u can be healthy and obese which im glad theres only a few comments like that which I just have to say you are dillusional!.\n\nI am going to get her an appointment with a therapist soon, I wont explicitly say its a therapist but a sort of talk session about different problems you might face and a place to get things of your chest. I feel like the word therapist scares some people. Also whenever I see her im gonna tell her not to drive because we are walking. Alot of people mentioned sports too, I could buy a basketball and see if she will play with me. I wont make any harsh desicions now but in my mind I will give her 5 months.

The agent tries to help but the customer screams some more and then hangs up.   \n  \n5 minutes later another agent has her on the line.  Same thing. No package. Screaming and yelling.  We are horrendous and she'll never shop with us again.  Screams and hangs up.   \n  \nAnother 5 minutes and I can tell that she's back on with a new agent.

"UnresolvedMysteries", "selftext": "On December 1, 2015, 19 year old Katelin Akens was visiting her family in Caroline County, Virginia because her sister, Gabi, had recently given birth to a baby boy, who Katelin was eager to meet. While she was there, Katelin\u2019s mother, Lisa Sullivan, said that Katelin was in good spirits, excited to hold her nephew in her arms and greet some old friends while in town. Katelin was in Caroline County from the 1st of December to the 5th. Katelin was supposed to stay longer but was unable to as she was to start cosmetology school on the 7th. \n \nOn the 5th, her last day in Virginia, Katelin had plans to fly out of Reagan National Airport in Arlington at 5:40 PM. Lisa was to arrive to work by 10:00 AM, meaning that she was unable to drop Katelin off at the airport. Instead, Lisa resorted to her last option and contacted her ex-husband and Katelin\u2019s former stepfather, James Branton, who helped raise Katelin and Gabi, and asked him to do the favor of dropping Katelin off at the airport. James agreed, and Lisa dropped Katelin off at his residence in Partlow, Virginia at 9:20 AM, approximately 80 miles away from the airport. According to Lisa, Katelin and James appeared to be happy to see each other. James was expressing interest in Katelin\u2019s aspirations in cosmetology school while the two discussed her future comfortably on the couch together. \n\nWhile Lisa reaffirmed what time Katelin needs to be dropped off, James said that he has to arrive to work at 3:00, and that Katelin would have to be dropped off a little earlier than the departure time. This was fine with both Lisa and Katelin, and Lisa said goodbye to her daughter for the last time. Katelin never arrived to the airport that day.\n\n**Timeline of Events**\n\n**11:56 AM**\n\nKatelin texts her fianc\u00e9e, Amber, who she lived with in Arizona, \n\nKatelin: \u201cSomething came up. I\u2019m not coming back today, I\u2019ll let you know when I get a new flight\u201d \n\nIn a separate text, she immediately then said,\n\n \u201cI won\u2019t be able to text for a bit\u201d \n\n**1:52 PM**\n\nAt 1:52, James texts Lisa,\n\n James: \u201cI dropped Katelin off.\u201d\n\nLisa: \u201cOk thank you\u201d\n\n\u201cHow was traffic\u201d\n\n James: \u201cNot too bad\u201d\n\nLisa said this next text concerned her,\n\nJames: \u201cI dropped her at the Springfield metro station. She was going to take the metro to the airport since there is a stop at Reagan.\u201d\n\nJames claimed that Katelin had asked to be dropped off at the Springfield mall to kill some time before her flight would depart, and that he simply obliged. Katelin would take the Metro Station to Reagan Airport, which was two stops away. Lisa found this peculiar as Katelin was allegedly unfamiliar with the Metro Station and hasn\u2019t been there since she was about six or seven years old.\n\n**2:00 PM**\n\nJust 8 minutes after Lisa received her initial text from James, Lisa received a text from Katelin, reading,\n\nKatelin: \u201cI\u2019m at the airport. Battery dying so won\u2019t be able to text for a bit\u201d \n\nLisa: \u201cOk let me know when you get on the plane.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t find the exact time stamp, but Amber texted Lisa that \u201csomething was wrong\u201d with Katelin\u2019s flight, and that she wouldn\u2019t be coming home that day. Amber notified Lisa of the situation because it she thought the lack of information was strange, and wanted to know if Lisa knew anything about Katelin\u2019s flight. This was after Lisa received the 2:00 PM text from her daughter, and Lisa had believed for some time that Katelin had already arrived to the airport. Confused, Lisa became increasingly worried. \n\n**7:15 PM**\n\n2 hours after her flight departed, Lisa received two separate final texts from Katelin. They read,\n\nKatelin: \u201cI\u2019m staying with a friend\u201d \n\n\u201cI need some time alone\u201d \n\nIn three texts, Lisa replied,\n\nLisa: \u201cCall me\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very worried about you\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease call me\u201d\n\nLisa believed that this behavior was unlike her daughter, and one thing that stood out as unusual was the fact that she had double texted. Lisa claims, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t do that [double text], she\u2019ll be wait for you to respond and then send another one. It wasn\u2019t her style.\u201d Lisa believes that Katelin didn\u2019t send these messages out herself. \n\nKatelin wouldn\u2019t answer any texts or phone calls since Lisa last received those messages. Lisa said, \u201cIt was like that until her phone just stopped ringing.\u201d \n\n\n**Later that day**\n\nAccording to Amber, not long after Katelin sent Lisa her final text messages, she directly messaged Amber through Facebook and said,\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t come back. I cheated on you.\u201d\n\nAmber believes that this was uncharacteristic of Katelin, and to her, everything seemed to be fine up until the day of her disappearance. They haven\u2019t had a recent argument or had been upset with each other, and Katelin\u2019s family is insistent that Katelin was excited to see Amber and start cosmetology school. Lisa and Gabi believe that they would have noticed if Katelin had been acting differently than usual, and that if she had a problem, their bond was strong enough that she wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to confide with them. \n\n**December 7**\n\nOn December 7th, two days after Katelin disappeared, Katelin\u2019s luggage was discovered by a  road crew worker in a drainage ditch in the 6600 block of River Road near Fredricksburg, approximately 44 miles away from the Springfield Metro Station. It appeared to have been thrown out of a moving vehicle. Detective Rob Marshall said, \u201cThere was one wheel missing, and scuff marks on the luggage which was a clear indication that it had tumbled.\u201d \n\nThe suitcase contained her wallet, cash, debit cards, and her plane ticket home, but was missing her clothes, her cellphone, and her high school diploma, which she needed to provide to the cosmetology school. The contents that remained inside the suitcase were allegedly \u201cstill neatly packed.\u201d\n\nSources make different claims regarding the contents of the suitcase. Some say that all articles of clothing were missing, but others say that just a few articles of clothing were missing. But, according to Lisa and Gabi, all articles of clothing were missing. \n\n**Investigation**\n\nThere is no surveillance footage that shows Katelin at the mall, airport or at the Springfield Metro Station. While footage didn\u2019t catch Katelin, investigators revealed that police have corroborated James\u2019s story that he dropped her off in Northern Virginia. They did not reveal how the story was corroborated, saying that it is an important detail in an ongoing investigation.\n\nThe source that claims James\u2019 story was corroborated was written in 2015, 5 days after Katelin was last seen. Some news sources reported that James\u2019 story was corroborated as early as two days after Katelin\u2019s disappeared. It wasn\u2019t until December of 2016, one year after Katelin\u2019s disappearance, that news sources reported that there was no evidence that Katelin ever left the Fredricksburg area, and that they will be speaking to James to \u201ctighten up the timeline.\u201d See \u201cEdit 2\u201d at the bottom of the post for references to the news articles as they were reported since just days after Katelin\u2019s disappearance. \n\nIn 2017, in an interview with True Crime Daily, when asked if surveillance footage captured anything, Lisa said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t pick up her at all, or him, or his vehicles. Nothing. There\u2019s no trace of him being out there.\u201d \n\nInvestigators examined location records from Katelin and James\u2019 cellphones, which told a very different story from that of Branton\u2019s.\n\nAt 1:56, when Katelin messaged Lisa she was at the airport, Katelin\u2019s phone pinged at a location more than 30 miles away from the Metro Station. When James messaged Lisa at 2:00, saying that he dropped Katelin off, his phone pinged closer to his home. \n\nWhen Lisa received Katelin\u2019s final texts at 7:15, Katelin\u2019s cellphone pinged off a cell tower in Stafford, less than 15 miles from where her luggage was discovered. According to Lisa, investigators believe that Katelin never left the area surrounding James\u2019 residence. Senior Detective Sharon Williams of the Spotsylvania County Sheriff\u2019s Office said, \u201cHer phone was never there at 2:00 PM. Her phone was in Fredericksburg, it was in Spotsy. And it never went farther north than Stafford.\u201d\n\nThough he initially accepted to take a polygraph test, James has since declined to take the test and also has yet to provide his cell phone\u2019s password to investigators. James also told Lisa that he would be dropping off Katelin earlier than 5:40 because he was to arrive at work at 3:00, but James failed to arrive to work that day. James called in to let them know that he wouldn\u2019t be arriving. \n\nWhen FOX 5 DC contacted local detectives who are in the process of investigating leads in Katelin\u2019s case, Detective Marshall claimed that they have not spoken to James in two years, and that he allegedly \u201cHas nothing to do with us.\u201d\n\nInvestigators searched his residence, vehicles,\nexamined a variety of guns, confiscated electronics, and collected DNA samples, but no physical evidence would indicate that he was responsible, or involved, in Katelin\u2019s disappearance. \n\nKevin Eastridge, Katelin\u2019s close friend, claimed that Katelin revealed to him on several occasions that James was abusive. Kevin claims that he knows he was \u201cdefinitely verbally abusive,\u201d but that Katelin never revealed whether or not he was ever physically abusive. \n\nAccording to investigators, it is possible that Katelin hasn\u2019t met with foul play, and had ran away. While Lisa and Katelin\u2019s family aren\u2019t convinced that she would disappear on her own terms, Detective Marshall said that shortly before her disappearance, Katelin messaged a friend over Facebook and said something along the lines of \u201cThat she doesn't want to be here, meaning Virginia, and she doesn't want to be in Arizona.\u201d\n\nPrior to her disappearance, Katelin texted Kevin, \u201cI really need someone to talk to.\u201d According to Kevin, Katelin told him that she had been partying the night before her departure with a friend who attended her former high school, and that friend\u2019s boyfriend. \n\nKatelin, her friend, and her friend\u2019s boyfriend, had all been drinking when the couple had, according to Kevin, \u201cforced themselves onto her.\u201d Katelin wrote, \n\n\u201cHer boyfriend got me really really drunk and then he kissed me and then she kissed me. Then we started playing a card game and everything went back to normal. Then we were watching a movie in (anonymous) lap with (anonymous) cause there wasn\u2019t enough space for 3 people in there little couch and then he started kissing me and touching me and so was (anonymous) we all ended up having sex. Like together. And then I went to bed and cried. And I stayed the night so then today it was super awkward between us all. We\u2019re all okay now but I fucked up :p\u201d\n\nAccording to Kevin, Katelin felt guilty the next morning because she felt as if she had cheated on Amber, saying that \u201cshe felt like she was a bad person for doing it.\u201d Katelin wrote in a later message, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to feel or anything. I\u2019ve been depressed and crying all day.\u201d\n\nInvestigators continue to investigate the possibilities that Katelin met with foul play or disappeared on her own accord. Lisa and Katelin\u2019s relatives believe that James is responsible for her disappearance. Lisa claims that James refuses to cooperate in the investigation or speak to the media and hasn\u2019t attended any events dedicated to finding Katelin. \n\nNearly 4 years later, Katelin\u2019s case remains unsolved. \n\nLinks:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/amp.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/virginia-womans-disappearance-continues-to-puzzle-police-two-years-later\n\nhttps://disappearedblog.com/katelin-akens/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_56c78012e4b041136f16f6b7/amp\n\nhttps://truecrimedaily.com/2017/02/01/confession-or-cry-for-help-missing-teens-texts-conflict-with-locations/ \n\n\nhttps://www.fredericksburg.com/news/crime_courts/spotsylvania-stepfather-took-woman-to-mall-before-she-disappeared/article_d1261048-9f60-11e5-8ac1-9bfcd1eaae4e.html\n\nEdit: Additional details included.\n\nEdit 2: On December 7, 2015, two days after Katelin\u2019s disappearance, ABC 7 reported that \u201cSpotsylvania Sheriff's Office investigators say surveillance cameras corroborate Katelin Akens' stepfather's account of events surrounding the disappearance of the teen.\u201d\n\nA series of tweets written by Stephen Tschida, an anchor with ABC 7, claimed, \n\n\u201cStepfather is not a suspect in disappearance of 19 year old Katelin Akens.

While she was there, Katelin\u2019s mother, Lisa Sullivan, said that Katelin was in good spirits, excited to hold her nephew in her arms and greet some old friends while in town. Katelin was in Caroline County from the 1st of December to the 5th. Katelin was supposed to stay longer but was unable to as she was to start cosmetology school on the 7th. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the 5th, her last day in Virginia, Katelin had plans to fly out of Reagan National Airport in Arlington at 5:40 PM. Lisa was to arrive to work by 10:00 AM, meaning that she was unable to drop Katelin off at the airport. Instead, Lisa resorted to her last option and contacted her ex-husband and Katelin\u2019s former stepfather, James Branton, who helped raise Katelin and Gabi, and asked him to do the favor of dropping Katelin off at the airport. James agreed, and Lisa dropped Katelin off at his residence in Partlow, Virginia at 9:20 AM, approximately 80 miles away from the airport. According to Lisa, Katelin and James appeared to be happy to see each other. James was expressing interest in Katelin\u2019s aspirations in cosmetology school while the two discussed her future comfortably on the couch together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While Lisa reaffirmed what time Katelin needs to be dropped off, James said that he has to arrive to work at 3:00, and that Katelin would have to be dropped off a little earlier than the departure time. This was fine with both Lisa and Katelin, and Lisa said goodbye to her daughter for the last time. Katelin never arrived to the airport that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeline of Events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11:56 AM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Katelin texts her fianc\u00e9e, Amber, who she lived with in Arizona, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Katelin: \u201cSomething came up. I\u2019m not coming back today, I\u2019ll let you know when I get a new flight\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a separate text, she immediately then said,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI won\u2019t be able to text for a bit\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:52 PM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 1:52, James texts Lisa,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;James: \u201cI dropped Katelin off.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lisa: \u201cOk thank you\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow was traffic\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;James: \u201cNot too bad\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lisa said this next text concerned her,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;James: \u201cI dropped her at the Springfield metro station. She was going to take the metro to the airport since there is a stop at Reagan.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;James claimed that Katelin had asked to be dropped off at the Springfield mall to kill some time before her flight would depart, and that he simply obliged. Katelin would take the Metro Station to Reagan Airport, which was two stops away. Lisa found this peculiar as Katelin was allegedly unfamiliar with the Metro Station and hasn\u2019t been there since she was about six or seven years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:00 PM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just 8 minutes after Lisa received her initial text from James, Lisa received a text from Katelin, reading,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Katelin: \u201cI\u2019m at the airport. Battery dying so won\u2019t be able to text for a bit\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lisa: \u201cOk let me know when you get on the plane.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t find the exact time stamp, but Amber texted Lisa that \u201csomething was wrong\u201d with Katelin\u2019s flight, and that she wouldn\u2019t be coming home that day. Amber notified Lisa of the situation because it she thought the lack of information was strange, and wanted to know if Lisa knew anything about Katelin\u2019s flight. This was after Lisa received the 2:00 PM text from her daughter, and Lisa had believed for some time that Katelin had already arrived to the airport. Confused, Lisa became increasingly worried. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:15 PM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 hours after her flight departed, Lisa received two separate final texts from Katelin. They read,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Katelin: \u201cI\u2019m staying with a friend\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI need some time alone\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In three texts, Lisa replied,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lisa: \u201cCall me\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI am very worried about you\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPlease call me\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lisa believed that this behavior was unlike her daughter, and one thing that stood out as unusual was the fact that she had double texted. Lisa claims, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t do that [double text], she\u2019ll be wait for you to respond and then send another one. It wasn\u2019t her style.\u201d Lisa believes that Katelin didn\u2019t send these messages out herself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Katelin wouldn\u2019t answer any texts or phone calls since Lisa last received those messages. Lisa said, \u201cIt was like that until her phone just stopped ringing.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Later that day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to Amber, not long after Katelin sent Lisa her final text messages, she directly messaged Amber through Facebook and said,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI can\u2019t come back. I cheated on you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amber believes that this was uncharacteristic of Katelin, and to her, everything seemed to be fine up until the day of her disappearance. They haven\u2019t had a recent argument or had been upset with each other, and Katelin\u2019s family is insistent that Katelin was excited to see Amber and start cosmetology school. Lisa and Gabi believe that they would have noticed if Katelin had been acting differently than usual, and that if she had a problem, their bond was strong enough that she wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to confide with them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On December 7th, two days after Katelin disappeared, Katelin\u2019s luggage was discovered by a  road crew worker in a drainage ditch in the 6600 block of River Road near Fredricksburg, approximately 44 miles away from the Springfield Metro Station. It appeared to have been thrown out of a moving vehicle. Detective Rob Marshall said, \u201cThere was one wheel missing, and scuff marks on the luggage which was a clear indication that it had tumbled.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The suitcase contained her wallet, cash, debit cards, and her plane ticket home, but was missing her clothes, her cellphone, and her high school diploma, which she needed to provide to the cosmetology school. The contents that remained inside the suitcase were allegedly \u201cstill neatly packed.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sources make different claims regarding the contents of the suitcase. Some say that all articles of clothing were missing, but others say that just a few articles of clothing were missing. But, according to Lisa and Gabi, all articles of clothing were missing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no surveillance footage that shows Katelin at the mall, airport or at the Springfield Metro Station. While footage didn\u2019t catch Katelin, investigators revealed that police have corroborated James\u2019s story that he dropped her off in Northern Virginia. They did not reveal how the story was corroborated, saying that it is an important detail in an ongoing investigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The source that claims James\u2019 story was corroborated was written in 2015, 5 days after Katelin was last seen. Some news sources reported that James\u2019 story was corroborated as early as two days after Katelin\u2019s disappeared. It wasn\u2019t until December of 2016, one year after Katelin\u2019s disappearance, that news sources reported that there was no evidence that Katelin ever left the Fredricksburg area, and that they will be speaking to James to \u201ctighten up the timeline.\u201d See \u201cEdit 2\u201d at the bottom of the post for references to the news articles as they were reported since just days after Katelin\u2019s disappearance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2017, in an interview with True Crime Daily, when asked if surveillance footage captured anything, Lisa said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t pick up her at all, or him, or his vehicles. Nothing. There\u2019s no trace of him being out there.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Investigators examined location records from Katelin and James\u2019 cellphones, which told a very different story from that of Branton\u2019s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 1:56, when Katelin messaged Lisa she was at the airport, Katelin\u2019s phone pinged at a location more than 30 miles away from the Metro Station. When James messaged Lisa at 2:00, saying that he dropped Katelin off, his phone pinged closer to his home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Lisa received Katelin\u2019s final texts at 7:15, Katelin\u2019s cellphone pinged off a cell tower in Stafford, less than 15 miles from where her luggage was discovered. According to Lisa, investigators believe that Katelin never left the area surrounding James\u2019 residence. Senior Detective Sharon Williams of the Spotsylvania County Sheriff\u2019s Office said, \u201cHer phone was never there at 2:00 PM. Her phone was in Fredericksburg, it was in Spotsy. And it never went farther north than Stafford.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though he initially accepted to take a polygraph test, James has since declined to take the test and also has yet to provide his cell phone\u2019s password to investigators. James also told Lisa that he would be dropping off Katelin earlier than 5:40 because he was to arrive at work at 3:00, but James failed to arrive to work that day. James called in to let them know that he wouldn\u2019t be arriving. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When FOX 5 DC contacted local detectives who are in the process of investigating leads in Katelin\u2019s case, Detective Marshall claimed that they have not spoken to James in two years, and that he allegedly \u201cHas nothing to do with us.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Investigators searched his residence, vehicles,\nexamined a variety of guns, confiscated electronics, and collected DNA samples, but no physical evidence would indicate that he was responsible, or involved, in Katelin\u2019s disappearance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kevin Eastridge, Katelin\u2019s close friend, claimed that Katelin revealed to him on several occasions that James was abusive. Kevin claims that he knows he was \u201cdefinitely verbally abusive,\u201d but that Katelin never revealed whether or not he was ever physically abusive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to investigators, it is possible that Katelin hasn\u2019t met with foul play, and had ran away. While Lisa and Katelin\u2019s family aren\u2019t convinced that she would disappear on her own terms, Detective Marshall said that shortly before her disappearance, Katelin messaged a friend over Facebook and said something along the lines of \u201cThat she doesn&amp;#39;t want to be here, meaning Virginia, and she doesn&amp;#39;t want to be in Arizona.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to her disappearance, Katelin texted Kevin, \u201cI really need someone to talk to.\u201d According to Kevin, Katelin told him that she had been partying the night before her departure with a friend who attended her former high school, and that friend\u2019s boyfriend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Katelin, her friend, and her friend\u2019s boyfriend, had all been drinking when the couple had, according to Kevin, \u201cforced themselves onto her.\u201d Katelin wrote, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHer boyfriend got me really really drunk and then he kissed me and then she kissed me.

Problem of course was they didn't want to work in it, but also didn't want to hire an experienced manager to run it either. As you can assume, problems ensued from the get go.\n\nMy MC was late on in the summer. My job was to clear and clean all the tables, wash and dry all the dishes and make sure the floor was spotless. The problem of course was that that takes at least 2 people to do on a calm day, never mind busy weekends in the midst of summer holidays and as the boss didn't work there, he assumed I could do it all by myself. Now I didn't have any frame of reference for how hard a job actually should be so for the entire summer I had been busting my ass doing all this and barely making it work. I had adopted so many shortcuts that the dishwasher never actually got used as the baristas were telling me to hand wash stuff as they needed to serve it. We barely had enough cups to have the place full of coffee guzzlers and have some dirty to wash in the kitchen. So that meant I was in the kitchen most of the time scrubbing, and barely having enough time to run out and lift dirty trays, but I still managed to do both. (Looking back now I actually had to physically run around the cafe at times make it all work, wtf) Of course the boss would walk in randomly in the day and I'd get a telling off for the floor being dirty, or a tray on a table. Didn't matter if the tray had been there 10 seconds, it was my fault.\n\nNow I had dealt with this all so far, sucked it up and just pushed on thinking I must have just been slow.That was until the busiest day of the year, when we have a show in town. The place was full and with town so busy, people didn't even mind standing with no seats to have a drink. The boss gets called in as we are swamped and not coping (no cups, long queue of angry customers, people sitting at dirty tables). When he walks in he immediately points at every table with an empty cup on it and then says there is no cutlery, only to further add that the floor is a disgrace. I brick it and run out to the floor to clean and ask him to cover the dish washing for a minute (I had been stuck hand washing dishes just so that baristas had something to put coffee in). He's appalled, but complies. It's only when I get back I see he's obviously never worked back here before. He's actually spent the entire time I'm on the floor just packing a handful of dishes onto a dishwasher tray. The problem being that it takes ages to pack and wash and he hasn't cleared any space for my new dishes to be placed. I shit myself and ask him to help move stuff so I can set the new tray down. He flips it as if he's shocked I can't wash dishes in my own hands (bear in mind I've a tray of maybe 8 cups, teapots, icecream cones etc). He gets a space and the baristas start asking for cups. I start hand washing one to hand over and he scowls at me.\n\n\"Everything must go through the dishwasher.\", and then he walks off to mingle at front of house again.\n\nAlright mate. If you want it that way, then have it that way. I start packing up the dishwasher and try to organise the stacks of trays.\n\nNot 2 minutes go by before 4 baristas are screaming for cups and teapots. I just have to tell them bosses new rules.\n\nBoss now flies in and whips open the dishwasher before it's done telling me to start handwashing again. I start handwashing and he immediately follows with, \"There are tables out there with dishes.\"\n\nI had been pretty frightened of him to now, but having seen him start to lose his cool a little, it dawned on me that I was being overworked, and this guy didn't even know it yet. So instead of making any point or argument I realise the bast way to let him know is by showing him. I leave to get a full tray form out front. It takes a while to stack a few tables trays together, and while I was doing that he was sweating in the back following baristas cleaning orders, hand doing dishes as they were needed. Of course when I get back, there is again nowhere to put the trays and he's now scowling at everyone as if we had constructed the building ourselves.\n\nAgain when I say nowhere to put trays, I am including the floor, where trays were already stacked.\n\nHe then runs out when I get the trays unpacked into some stacks of dishes and he's back to the front of house.\n\nI have then to start cutlery, anyone that's worked in a restaurant or cafe knows the bane of cutlery.\n\nI'm nearly done scrubbing cutlery clean when Boss reappears and without looking pours coffee and tea onto my cleaned cutlery in the sink. At this point I can see he's defeated. He knows how precious my time is suddenly and he knows he's just fucked me over by doing that. His eyes are just wide with an aura of *fuck.*\n\nHe walks back out, still holding the now empty mugs and leaves me to start the cutlery anew.\n\nMaybe a minute goes by when he walks back in and just asks me to tell him how I do my job.\n\n**FUCKING FINALLY!!**\n\nI wash and talk, telling him all the little tricks and tips for making sure shit is still moving out the front. I can tell now from his face as I relay how this place actually works that he genuinely didn't know. I can see somewhere in his head he's just realised how he must have been treating myself and other younger staff all summer to this point. He's sort of looking a bit broken. 15 minutes into working at his own cafe and he's broken.\n\nThe rest of the shift he had his wife come down and the three of us worked the full shift to close. At the end of the day he actually apologised for making me work like that and he'd always have staff on the accommodate busy shifts. I actually went to work for him every summer after that until I left college. I actually really appreciated his reaction to that day and always did a little extra than I needed to and in return he always paid me a little better for the extra work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR :Boss overworks me to death only to have to do the job one day with me and realise what he's been doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Apologies for the NSFW tag, it was an automated response for swearing I guess. If you want your r/MaliciousErotica you'll have to go elsewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: Great to see so many people talking about their horrific service jobs in the comments. We all share each other's pain; let's heal together.   \nAlso I see some outrage about hand washing in the comments and I understand that, but 16 year old me in my first job did whatever 20 something year old employees asked. I still made sure I was using piping hot water and soap, and after this instance nothing was served without being machine washed as we had staff to make sure everything ran smoothly.   \nAlso a few people calling BS as no disposable cups in a cafe, but for a bit of context this cafe is a way out from town by a beach (cold climate, not tropical). People come to get out of the cold, not grab a coffee on their way to work, so Boss didn't think to spend money on stock that he didn't need all too often (First month, he soon learned to keep better stock).", "author_fullname": "t2_e9c7l", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Walk a shift in my shoes bossman", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MaliciousCompliance", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "lf", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_a1xsu8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11500, "domain": "self.MaliciousCompliance", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "L", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11500, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "nsfw", "edited": 1543665862.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 1}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1543650212.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 3, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first job when I was a teen was as a dishwasher in a coffee shop that was just open a month in my seaside town.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The owners had just left other jobs with a bit of cash and set up the place thinking it&amp;#39;d be easy money ticking over in the background of their retirements.
