at the bottom.\nEDIT # 2 to add a huge and bewildered thanks for the star!! Pretty exciting news for me! \n\nIt was really the BIG story that I'll always remember from my serving days. It was about 5 years ago. Nothing like it has happened to me/near me before or since.\n\nI was a server at a popular mid-range/slightly upscale restaurant. The job was great, mostly for the hours accommodating my school schedule, the tips, and the couple of great friends I made there. Always dealt with a handful of assholes, but I typically always just let it go and moved on. \n\nOn the night in question, the hostess sat a couple in my section, about mid-30's, man and woman, the guy seemed to be a business type, and the woman was a total knockout blonde Pam Anderson type. I went up and did my normal introductory spiel, but the man held up his hand to silence me, and without looking at me, said \"I'll have a whiskey on the rocks, she'll have Chardonnay\". I paused, looked at them for a second, and said, \"Great, I'll get started on those. In the meantime, enjoy some complimentary bre-\" and once again, he snapped at me, \"We'll call you when we're ready to order.\" \n\nI leave, resigning myself to the fact that this dude is already unhappy for some reason, and will likely take it out on me. So I keep close tabs on them, ensuring I don't mess anything up. \n\nWhen it came time to order, he wanted our supreme burger, and he specified that he wanted no mustard, as he was allergic to mustardseed. That was no problem. Except he didn't simply state he had this allergy, he said \"Think you can manage not to f*ck that up?\" I said I would make sure the kitchen knew about his allergy. \n\nWhen I brought out their appetizers, he shoved his empty whiskey glass into my chest/stomach area, hard, and said \"Another.\" I was stunned. As I left, the woman, presumably his wife, called out, \"Don't forget about the mustardseed!\" \n\nYeah, fine. I was done with them. The burger came out fine. No mustard. Before he ~allowed~ me to leave the table (he stuck his arm out in my path), he pulled the burger apart to make sure there was no mustard on it. \n\nThe check comes, he makes a comment about the burger being sloppy (no shit, Sherlock, I watched you tear it apart in front of me). And of course, he tipped $5 on a $100 bill. \n\nI was thankful to see him go. I prayed to god I would never see his face again.\n\nAnd here's where the title of my post comes in. It's a month later - he comes in and gets seated in my section again. Only he's with a different woman, a brunette.\n\nI try to get my friend to cover the table, but she couldn't for one reason for another, so I just grit my teeth and went in. \n\nAgain, he interrupted my \"How are you doing tonight?\" with a \"Whiskey on the rocks and a  Cosmo\" wave of his hand. \n\nWhen they ordered, he wanted our chef's soup of the day, a Spicy Lentil Soup. I immediately remembered, and said \"Oh, sir, that soup actually has ingredients that -\" and he snaps so suddenly that I flinched, \"Just get me what I ordered, what's wrong with you?\" And, ahh, he topped it off with \"RETARD\". (I'm so sorry if that language is frowned upon here in the boards, let me know). \n\nAt this point, the woman looks upset at his behavior, but I didn't wanna be responsible for this guy suing the restaurant just because the paste in the soup had ground mustardseed in it, so I plowed on, \"But it has mustardseed in it, last time you were here, both you and your wife reminded me to -\" \n\nAll hell broke loose. His face turned red and he looked like he would throw his glass at me. The brunette had jumped up, screaming, \"I shouldn't be surprised, I regret letting you back into my life, tell that slut I hope you two are happy together!\" And just storms out. \n\nThe guy sits still for a second, then turns to me, and I really truly thought he would hit me (at the time, a 21 yr old rather petite female). I turned as gracefully as I could and walked into another section of the restaurant and hoped he didn't follow me. Few minutes pass by, and I see he's gone. \n\nStiffed us on the drinks. That sucked. \n\nBut I had no remorse. I floated through the rest of my shift with a smile, knowing that this man was really just a bag of shit and that his life just probably crumbled in front of his eyes. \n\nWhy this dude had it out for me, I have no idea. Why he kept interrupting, no idea. Why he assumed I was stupid, no idea. \n\nBut the look of horror on his face when shit hit the fan was worth it. I'll remember it forever. \n\n**TL;DR** Incredibly rude customer goes to same restaurant with two different women and it comes full circle when he gets caught. \n\n**Another big note: There were just a few posters who assumed/accused me of saying \"both you and your wife reminded me -\" for the explicit purpose of letting the brunette know about it. That is not it AT ALL. The sentence simply slipped out of my mouth so fast, I didn't think. This man had such a demeanor that I was convinced if he ate mustardseed, he would sue me/the restaurant for every penny we had, and he terrified me. And, well, the simple assumption I made when I met him for the first time was \"oh hey, man and woman sitting together - must be husband and wife\" and then when I saw him with another woman, it didn't register as cheating, I was more preoccupied with how he was treating me rather than trying to discern if she was his sister, coworker, or friend. The word \"wife\" just came out as part of my sentence without any intent behind it. I don't know if the cynics will believe me, but that's how it was. *shrugs* ", "author_fullname": "t2_2djwjekz", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "Really horrible customer got caught cheating", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TalesFromYourServer", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_a1otu6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4064, "domain": "self.TalesFromYourServer", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Long", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4064, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1543582636.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 1, "gid_3": 0}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1543578579.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "contest_mode": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evenin&amp;#39;, I have been a LTL, but decided to post this doozy here! *On mobile&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT # 1 to add TL;DR at the bottom.\nEDIT # 2 to add a huge and bewildered thanks for the star!!

I went up and did my normal introductory spiel, but the man held up his hand to silence me, and without looking at me, said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll have a whiskey on the rocks, she&amp;#39;ll have Chardonnay&amp;quot;. I paused, looked at them for a second, and said, &amp;quot;Great, I&amp;#39;ll get started on those. In the meantime, enjoy some complimentary bre-&amp;quot; and once again, he snapped at me, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll call you when we&amp;#39;re ready to order.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I leave, resigning myself to the fact that this dude is already unhappy for some reason, and will likely take it out on me. So I keep close tabs on them, ensuring I don&amp;#39;t mess anything up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it came time to order, he wanted our supreme burger, and he specified that he wanted no mustard, as he was allergic to mustardseed. That was no problem. Except he didn&amp;#39;t simply state he had this allergy, he said &amp;quot;Think you can manage not to f*ck that up?&amp;quot; I said I would make sure the kitchen knew about his allergy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I brought out their appetizers, he shoved his empty whiskey glass into my chest/stomach area, hard, and said &amp;quot;Another.&amp;quot; I was stunned. As I left, the woman, presumably his wife, called out, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t forget about the mustardseed!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, fine. I was done with them. The burger came out fine. No mustard. Before he ~allowed~ me to leave the table (he stuck his arm out in my path), he pulled the burger apart to make sure there was no mustard on it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The check comes, he makes a comment about the burger being sloppy (no shit, Sherlock, I watched you tear it apart in front of me). And of course, he tipped $5 on a $100 bill. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was thankful to see him go. I prayed to god I would never see his face again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s where the title of my post comes in. It&amp;#39;s a month later - he comes in and gets seated in my section again. Only he&amp;#39;s with a different woman, a brunette.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try to get my friend to cover the table, but she couldn&amp;#39;t for one reason for another, so I just grit my teeth and went in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, he interrupted my &amp;quot;How are you doing tonight?&amp;quot; with a &amp;quot;Whiskey on the rocks and a  Cosmo&amp;quot; wave of his hand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they ordered, he wanted our chef&amp;#39;s soup of the day, a Spicy Lentil Soup. I immediately remembered, and said &amp;quot;Oh, sir, that soup actually has ingredients that -&amp;quot; and he snaps so suddenly that I flinched, &amp;quot;Just get me what I ordered, what&amp;#39;s wrong with you?&amp;quot; And, ahh, he topped it off with &amp;quot;RETARD&amp;quot;. (I&amp;#39;m so sorry if that language is frowned upon here in the boards, let me know). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, the woman looks upset at his behavior, but I didn&amp;#39;t wanna be responsible for this guy suing the restaurant just because the paste in the soup had ground mustardseed in it, so I plowed on, &amp;quot;But it has mustardseed in it, last time you were here, both you and your wife reminded me to -&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All hell broke loose. His face turned red and he looked like he would throw his glass at me. The brunette had jumped up, screaming, &amp;quot;I shouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised, I regret letting you back into my life, tell that slut I hope you two are happy together!&amp;quot; And just storms out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy sits still for a second, then turns to me, and I really truly thought he would hit me (at the time, a 21 yr old rather petite female). I turned as gracefully as I could and walked into another section of the restaurant and hoped he didn&amp;#39;t follow me. Few minutes pass by, and I see he&amp;#39;s gone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stiffed us on the drinks. That sucked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I had no remorse. I floated through the rest of my shift with a smile, knowing that this man was really just a bag of shit and that his life just probably crumbled in front of his eyes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why this dude had it out for me, I have no idea. Why he kept interrupting, no idea. Why he assumed I was stupid, no idea. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the look of horror on his face when shit hit the fan was worth it. I&amp;#39;ll remember it forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; Incredibly rude customer goes to same restaurant with two different women and it comes full circle when he gets caught. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Another big note: There were just a few posters who assumed/accused me of saying &amp;quot;both you and your wife reminded me -&amp;quot; for the explicit purpose of letting the brunette know about it. That is not it AT ALL. The sentence simply slipped out of my mouth so fast, I didn&amp;#39;t think. This man had such a demeanor that I was convinced if he ate mustardseed, he would sue me/the restaurant for every penny we had, and he terrified me. And, well, the simple assumption I made when I met him for the first time was &amp;quot;oh hey, man and woman sitting together - must be husband and wife&amp;quot; and then when I saw him with another woman, it didn&amp;#39;t register as cheating, I was more preoccupied with how he was treating me rather than trying to discern if she was his sister, coworker, or friend. The word &amp;quot;wife&amp;quot; just came out as part of my sentence without any intent behind it. I don&amp;#39;t know if the cynics will believe me, but that&amp;#39;s how it was. *shrugs&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": null, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2v480", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "a1otu6", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PotterQuoter", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 241, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/a1otu6/really_horrible_customer_got_caught_cheating/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/a1otu6/really_horrible_customer_got_caught_cheating/", "subreddit_subscribers": 217842, "created_utc": 1543549779.0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bestoflegaladvice", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_19lxnsh", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "[Update 1] LAOP\u2019s wife mentioned that their infertility issues were due to androgen insensitivity.

It was like out of a movie I saw her chatting with a group of people and in my head I heard \u201coh there she is\u201d. She was newly devorced and took some convincing on my part but we have been together from that night on and get along extremely well.\n\nNow for clarity I am extreamly attracted to my wife, we may just still be in the honeymoon stage but I\u2019ve never felt this way about another women. And becasue it\u2019s pertains to the conversation we had today with her therapist I would say the majority of the population would find her attractive and not in a niche way. She is objectively attractive. I feel we are evenly matched in looks, very few people have notice the slight age difference. She however wins in personality (outgoing and charming) and she makes about 3X as much money as I do. \n\nA couple months ago we ran into an ex of mine, and by ex we literally dated for maybe a month and never exclusive. After my wife mentioned how different they were (age/hair color/body type etc) and it ended in a pretty heated argument. We have had 3/4 conversations since, all of which I was trying to convince my wife I\u2019m not going to leave her for a women I \u201cdated\u201d years ago. \n\nLast week she asked if I would go to her therapist with her today and I agreed. She has been seeing her for about 8 years for anxiety and a bout of depression that happed before we meet.\n\nToday:\n\nStarted normal enough and I had figured why we were there so I just jumped into it thinking the therapist would be on my side and would help me calm my wife\u2019s fears. That\u2019s not what happed.\n\nThe therapist did very little talking although their long silences and knowing glances started to piss me off right away.\n\nThe thing that stood out to me the most was how my wife reiterated how she doesn\u2019t see how I would be attracted to her and the therapist didn\u2019t even disagree. Like I felt like a crazy person, my wife is beautiful, charming, funny, it feels like I wished her into existence.\n\nShe brought up the age difference (7 years?!?), my looks, and how quickly I wanted to get married as all reasons for why I am basically a gold digger. \n\nFirst off we both wanted to get married quickly, I asked and figured she would want a long engagement but she didn\u2019t so we got married. Second I never even discussed money with her until after we were married and never dreamed she made so much more than I do. She said she doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m after her money but enjoy the lifestyle while I\u2019m with her and it makes it easier to pretend I\u2019m attracted to her. Sorry more attracted to her, like I play it up. \n\nI\u2019m completely blind sided and don\u2019t really want to talk to my family or friends, it\u2019s humiliating being accused of marrying someone for a lifestyle.\n\nFor clarity: I moved into her house, I rent out my old home but that income just covers the mortgage and the company that manages it. All our money goes into a joint checking with automatic transfers into savings etc. Our bills are paid from that account, I looked at our bank account and I spend significantly less than she does each month on average. \n\nAfter leaving I\u2019m in a complete panic that she is going to leave me, even though I feel humiliated and love her so much. I immediately wanted to offer to sign a prenup or separate bank accounts or both but I just froze.\n\nMy wife seem so sad and I\u2019m so frustrated, I didn\u2019t even do anything wrong. The women I\u2019ve dated in my past don\u2019t have a similar type and to be honest I didn\u2019t really date, more like hook up for a few months then moved on. I love my wife, she is the first women I have ever met that I have had a real partnership with, like we were a team and now that\u2019s all gone. \n\nI don\u2019t feel like I have the strength to leave her, it scares me that I can\u2019t even envision a scenario where I would leave. She is my most favorite person.\n\nHow do I rebuild trust when I don\u2019t feel I ever did anything to lose it. \n\n\nEdit: My wife didn\u2019t come home last night but I texted her this morning. First apologizing for leaving the session and then asking her to come home so we could formulate a plan. No word back yet but I doubt she will check her phone before lunch if she went to work. \n\nThanks for letting me vent, I\u2019ve already asked my insurance company to send a list of counselors for me to call later today.

"UnresolvedMysteries", "selftext": "On December 14, 2014, a teenage boy discovered a woman\u2019s embalmed severed head lay in the woods, 30 feet off a rural road in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. The road itself is located in a residential area with only about a dozen homes and minimal traffic where it\u2019s mainly used by locals as a shortcut to and from route 989.\n\n Her eyes were shut, and her mouth was agape. Investigators scoured the surrounding area where the head was discovered, but there weren\u2019t any other remains to be found. The woman\u2019s face was still recognizable, but a facial reconstruction turned up no information on the woman\u2019s identity. It was estimated that the head had been there between one and four weeks.\n\nJudging by her short gray, or partially gray hair and older appearance, Jane Doe is approximately between the ages of 50-80 years old. The woman\u2019s head was examined by forensic artist and anatomy professor Michelle Vitali, who determined Jane Doe\u2019s head was severed by someone with anatomical skill. She says, \u201cWhen we lifted the flap at the back of the neck, we could see that the whole purpose of that was to access the key joint that would preserve both the head and the vertebral column. This is not anybody going with a kitchen knife or anything remotely like that. It was well done, and it was placed perfectly. She was dismembered professionally.\u201d\n\nAside from this, it was also found that Jane Doe\u2019s eyes were closed shut with the use of \u201ceye caps,\u201d a commonly used mortician\u2019s tool. When the eye caps were removed, the examiners discovered that Jane Doe\u2019s eyeballs had been removed, and were replaced with two red, rubber bouncy balls. While eye caps are commonly used in the mortician trade, there was no such practice that involved the use of what is essentially a children\u2019s toy. \n\nSalt Lake City-based IsoForensics Inc. completed isotope testing on Jane Doe\u2019s head. For those unfamiliar with the procedure, isotopes are elements in the body that come from drinking water that can be unique to particular geographical areas. As a result, it was determined that Jane Doe spent the last seven months living in several locations in areas ranging from Ohio's easternmost counties, southwestern Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and western Maryland to central and northeastern Pennsylvania and eastern New York. The test results predicted that in Jane Doe\u2019s last seven months, she had moved three to four times. However, there was no evidence that she lived in Beaver County in the months prior to her death. Due to the embalming fluid, the time of death could not be determined. According to investigators, the embalming process also compromised DNA. The little DNA that was salvaged led to no matches in the national database. It\u2019s important to note that the Reuters article makes a different claim, stating, \u201cthe remains held no DNA; it had been destroyed by the embalming chemicals.\u201d The Reuters article is the most recent article, but other articles contradict this statement. It seems as if that the DNA was compromised, but that they were still able to obtain a usable sample. I can\u2019t find any other sources that claim it was completely destroyed and ultimately unusable. \n\nFoul play is not suspected in Jane Doe\u2019s death, but it hasn\u2019t been entirely ruled out, either. The autopsy revealed that Jane Doe likely passed away due to cardiac distress. This was determined as toxicology exams revealed traces Lidocaine and Atropine in her system, two medications used to treat irregular heart issues. However, one investigator said, \u201cProve to me it\u2019s not a homicide \u2013 that she was alive and someone killed her and played with that body, including putting the red eyeballs in there.\u201d\n\nBeaver County Coroner, Teri Tatalovich-Rossi, says, \u201cCould it have been someone with a great deal of anatomical knowledge? Yes. Could it have been someone who is just peculiar or bizarre? The answer to that question is also yes. We just don't know at this point.\u201d\n\nBorough Police Chief Michael O'Brien said the head was found too far off the road to have landed in its location accidentally. Animals moving the head had also been ruled out because the embalming fluid would have made it unappealing. \n\nInvestigators contacted funeral homes that are apart of the Pennsylvania Directors Association, and details about the case were presented at a National Funeral Directors Association conference. Police have all but eliminated grave robbery. The current lead that is being followed is that Jane Doe may have been involved in a black market trade that harvests remains. Beaver County District Attorney Anthony said, \u201cThere\u2019s a black market on body parts and that market is pretty extensive.\u201d Investigators believe that the head may have been severed by a body broker, an individual or firm who purchases and sells cadavers or remains. One reason that this lead is being investigated is because the industry has been linked to similar abuses in the past. Due to a plethora of firms where you can purchase human remains, to discover where Jane Doe\u2019s head came from is, according to Vitali, \u201chard to track.\u201d\n\nIf Jane Doe is to ever be identified, it would require the assistance of a dentist. It was discovered that Jane Doe has had work done on every single tooth, one of them as many as seven times. On one of three teeth that had been pulled, forensic dentists discovered a filling compound that wasn\u2019t available to dentists before 2004, indicating that Jane Doe passed thereafter. So far, analysis of Jane Doe\u2019s dental work has produced no leads. \n\nWith a forensic facial reconstruction, investigators still hope that someone, one day, will be identify the woman and give her name back. Nearly 4 years later, the woman remains unidentified, and her case unsolved. \n\nLinks: \n\nhttp://crimefeed.com/2016/02/pennsylvania-cops-baffled-by-the-head-with-no-body/\n\nhttps://triblive.com/news/beaver/9614512-74/beaver-woman-county\n\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/the-head-with-no-bodyand-no-answers\n\nhttp://theballreport.com/red-rubber-balls-found-in-severed-head-of-jane-doe/\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bodies-head-specialreport/special-report-a-womans-severed-head-was-found-in-the-woods-who-is-she-idUSKBN1D21B4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "author_fullname": "t2_fhykimf", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "In 2014, a teenager discovered the professionally severed, embalmed head of an older woman in Beaver County, Pennsylvania.

The road itself is located in a residential area with only about a dozen homes and minimal traffic where it\u2019s mainly used by locals as a shortcut to and from route 989.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her eyes were shut, and her mouth was agape. Investigators scoured the surrounding area where the head was discovered, but there weren\u2019t any other remains to be found. The woman\u2019s face was still recognizable, but a facial reconstruction turned up no information on the woman\u2019s identity. It was estimated that the head had been there between one and four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Judging by her short gray, or partially gray hair and older appearance, Jane Doe is approximately between the ages of 50-80 years old. The woman\u2019s head was examined by forensic artist and anatomy professor Michelle Vitali, who determined Jane Doe\u2019s head was severed by someone with anatomical skill. She says, \u201cWhen we lifted the flap at the back of the neck, we could see that the whole purpose of that was to access the key joint that would preserve both the head and the vertebral column. This is not anybody going with a kitchen knife or anything remotely like that. It was well done, and it was placed perfectly. She was dismembered professionally.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from this, it was also found that Jane Doe\u2019s eyes were closed shut with the use of \u201ceye caps,\u201d a commonly used mortician\u2019s tool. When the eye caps were removed, the examiners discovered that Jane Doe\u2019s eyeballs had been removed, and were replaced with two red, rubber bouncy balls. While eye caps are commonly used in the mortician trade, there was no such practice that involved the use of what is essentially a children\u2019s toy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake City-based IsoForensics Inc. completed isotope testing on Jane Doe\u2019s head. For those unfamiliar with the procedure, isotopes are elements in the body that come from drinking water that can be unique to particular geographical areas. As a result, it was determined that Jane Doe spent the last seven months living in several locations in areas ranging from Ohio&amp;#39;s easternmost counties, southwestern Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and western Maryland to central and northeastern Pennsylvania and eastern New York. The test results predicted that in Jane Doe\u2019s last seven months, she had moved three to four times. However, there was no evidence that she lived in Beaver County in the months prior to her death. Due to the embalming fluid, the time of death could not be determined. According to investigators, the embalming process also compromised DNA. The little DNA that was salvaged led to no matches in the national database. It\u2019s important to note that the Reuters article makes a different claim, stating, \u201cthe remains held no DNA; it had been destroyed by the embalming chemicals.\u201d The Reuters article is the most recent article, but other articles contradict this statement. It seems as if that the DNA was compromised, but that they were still able to obtain a usable sample. I can\u2019t find any other sources that claim it was completely destroyed and ultimately unusable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Foul play is not suspected in Jane Doe\u2019s death, but it hasn\u2019t been entirely ruled out, either. The autopsy revealed that Jane Doe likely passed away due to cardiac distress. This was determined as toxicology exams revealed traces Lidocaine and Atropine in her system, two medications used to treat irregular heart issues. However, one investigator said, \u201cProve to me it\u2019s not a homicide \u2013 that she was alive and someone killed her and played with that body, including putting the red eyeballs in there.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beaver County Coroner, Teri Tatalovich-Rossi, says, \u201cCould it have been someone with a great deal of anatomical knowledge? Yes. Could it have been someone who is just peculiar or bizarre? The answer to that question is also yes. We just don&amp;#39;t know at this point.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Borough Police Chief Michael O&amp;#39;Brien said the head was found too far off the road to have landed in its location accidentally. Animals moving the head had also been ruled out because the embalming fluid would have made it unappealing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Investigators contacted funeral homes that are apart of the Pennsylvania Directors Association, and details about the case were presented at a National Funeral Directors Association conference.
